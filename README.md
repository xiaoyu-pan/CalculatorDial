# Calculator-Dial
Calculator in Java with kids friendly dial face

I made the Java calculator in 2016 when I was trying to teach my daughter at middle school how to program in Java. My goal was to show her how easy and fun it is programming in Java. 

I first showed her a Youtube video programming a calculator in Java in just 15 minutes. But she seemed not impressed. I then told her that the interface can be easily polished to make it much fancier since designing GUI is just drag-and-drops.  She seemed interested.
However, I was too ambitious and trying to learn JavaFX Scene Builder rather than Swing GUI Builder, which is integrated in NetBeans, the IDE that I used for Java programming at the time. This took me a bit too long to make the app and my daughter quickly got bored and lost interest. 

The Java calculator app became my pet project and I finally finished after a prolonged period. The only thing that paid off was that my daughter was impressed by the GUI that I made. However, she was still not interested in learning programming. 

Fast forward to 2020, she plans to take computer class in the coming school year. I began to teach Java again in the summer to help her get ready to school since it is not going to be easy for her. 

She still remembered my Java calculator app and asked me to show her the codes. I was very excited to show her my work but after looking into my old files, install new version of JDK and NetBeans, my codes wonâ€™t compile because JavaFX SDK needs to be installed separately. The JDK has evolved into two flavors, Oracle JDK and Openjdk. I chose Openjdk as many people advised since it is free.

For IDE, I tried NetBeans, Eclipse, and Intellij but none of them are perfect. I chose Intellij to refactor the calculator app just because it seems more popular among young people, and my daughter is young.
